# FastAPIForDummies
A hands-on guide to FastAPI for beginners. Explore the code, run the examples, and start building your own APIs! 
Contributions and feedback are welcome. 

# What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs quickly and efficiently. It is built on top of Starlette (for handling asynchronous requests) and Pydantic (for data validation and serialization). FastAPI is particularly well-suited for building RESTful APIs and supports asynchronous programming out of the box.


# How is FastAPI Different from Django and Flask?
